Expected Output

The output must include one report file (both pdf and word) and one code folder. The code folder should contain three subfolders titled Sensor Model, Motion Model, and SLAM. The main executable code file must be specified as main, and it should be set up in such a way that it runs smoothly without errors in Google Colab or MATLAB2020b. The code should be written so that it loads the data automatically and, after execution, displays the results presented in the report file.

The report must be typed, with a maximum length of five pages, using font size 14, written in clear and understandable Persian, and free from unnecessary details. The report should include the code outputs, the implementation process of the algorithm, possible challenges, and, in case you could not achieve the expected results, the reasons should be explained. Grading will be based on this report file.

Report the sensor model in terms of bias and variance.

Report the motion model in terms of bias and the relative variance of the robot’s movement at each moment along x, y, θ.

Plot the extracted map using the GO method for SLAM in five stages; for example, show how the map becomes more accurate over time as more data are gathered.

Plot the final map obtained from the SLAM model in an organized manner, clearly showing the maze dimensions, the robot’s initial position, its trajectory, and its final position.
